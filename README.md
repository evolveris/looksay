# [Work in progress ðŸ› ] A simple LAN two-player game based on the look-and-say sequence

The first goal of this project was to experiment with web sockets (socket.io), whilst also getting to grips with TypeScript. The other one was to actually write the algorithm for the look-and-say sequence, as part of a long-term challenge to become better at problem-solving and JavaScript in general. 

It was super-fun to understand how web sockets work, as well as practicing the OOP approach to writing code. 

This is currently a work-in-progress project with a few more things on my to-do list, but I will be sure to update this file once I get to a version that I am happier with. 

## Start-up ðŸš€

Install packages:

### `npm install`

Install TypeScript globally:

### `npm install -g typescript`

Run the app locally:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)<br>

## TypeScript compilation ðŸ“Ÿ

At the moment, after any `.ts` file change, the JavaScript needs to be recompiled manually. Navigate to the root of the project and run this command in a new console tab. Be sure you have TypeScript installed globally.

### `tsc`
